Subject: RealSense D435 not detecting on Ubuntu 22.04

Hi everyone,

I'm having trouble getting my RealSense D435 to work on Ubuntu 22.04. Here's what I've tried:

1. Installed RealSense SDK 2.0 following the official guide
2. Connected camera via USB 3.0
3. Ran `rs-enumerate-devices` but no devices found

System info:
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- RealSense D435
- USB 3.0 port
- SDK version: 2.54.1

Error messages:
- `rs-enumerate-devices`: No devices found
- `dmesg`: No relevant USB errors

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks,
[Your name]
